### Welcome to "@exweiv/weiv-data" APIs

This is the official documentation page for weiv-data APIs powered by **ExWeiv Apps**, we have built an API library for you to use with your Wix sites. This package is designed to work in Wix websites with Velo and JS and mainly focused to developers not basic users but anyone can use it for free! Before we start here are the advantages and disadvantages of weiv-data when compared to wix-data.
