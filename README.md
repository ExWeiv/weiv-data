# weivData APIs

Connect MongoDB to your Wix website without wixData limits. Custom APIs designed to easily switch from wixData. Remove any wix-data platform limits with these APIs and only limited by MongoDB's limits. (You'll still be limited by backend limits of Wix if you use Wix's backend)

> Designed for backend use only don't use in frontend for better security.
